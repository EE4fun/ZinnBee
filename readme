ZinnBee is a project created for a design challenge at Elementer14 Community: Save The Bees

This repo contains the source codes of Arduino codes running on MKR1310/1300 and Nicla modules.
LoRa_WAN_Mockup: 
  A initial breadboard bench-testing project: A temperature sensor HTS221 is used on IoT carrier board and MKR1300 sends the measured temperature via LoRA WAN to 
  another MKR1300, which can display RTC time and temerature data received from LoRa WAN networking. A sd card logger is used for tracking the temperature and real time.
